# Portfolio
My main technical artefact for this project with my largest contributions is the Security Testing document of our project solution.

This document contains the necessary information that outlines the setup, hardware used, and all the testing processes involved to evaluating the security of the platform, as well as identifying any risks and then providing mitigations for any said risks.

## Showcasing Crucial Security Testing Results 
This section will briefly show a section of the main document to showcase a crucial recommendation to our digital solution.

In Kali Linux, once we switch the onboard Wi-Fi interface into monitor mode to allow wireless testing, we can use the tool called *airodump* to lock in a specific channel which was gained from an initial reconnaisance scan.
